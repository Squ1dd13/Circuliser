# Circuliser
Circular music visualiser for iOS.

The code in this repository is not *quite* the same as the code that is in the released version, because I've done a tiny bit of cleanup. The code probably doesn't compile any more, but that's OK. I've also removed the `packages` folder (ofc) and some build scripts specific to my machine.

## Circuliser is Not Free
I am releasing the source code because I planned to do so and because I like doing that, **not so you can compile the code and get the tweak for free**. If you want to use Circuliser, please [buy it from Chariz](https://chariz.com/buy/circuliser).

## Using the Code
This code is licenced under GPLv3, but there are a couple of additional requests I have:
- If this code is helpful to you either for learning or for actual use, please say so somewhere in a credits section. Nobody will know if you don't, but I would be very grateful if you do.
- If your project is commercial and my code is helpful, please buy Circuliser if you hadn't already done so.
